Description: This Package is implementing Benchmarking Method for Multivariate Small Area Estimation under Fay Herriot Model.  
    Multivariate Small Area Estimation (MSAE) is a development of Univariat Small Area Estimation that
    considering the correlation among response variables and borrowing the strength from auxiliary variables 
    effectiveness of a domain sample size, the multivariat model in this package is based on Multivariate
    model 1 proposed by Roberto Benavent and Domigo Morales (2015) <DOI: 10.1016/j.csda.2015.07.013.>.
    Benchmarking in Small Area Estimation is a modification of Small Area Estimation model to guarantees that the 
    aggreagate weighted mean of the county predictors equals the corresponding weighted mean of survey estimates.
    Difference Benchmarking is the simplest but widely used  by multiplying EBLUP estimator by the common adjustment 
    factor (J.N.K Rao and Isabela Molina, 2013).
