The goal of msaeDB is to implement Benchmarking Method for Multivariate Small Area Estimation under Fay Herriot Model.  
    Multivariate Small Area Estimation (MSAE) is a development of Univariat Small Area Estimation that
    considering the correlation among response variables and borrowing the strength from auxiliary variables 
    effectiveness of a domain sample size, the multivariat model in this package is based on Multivariate
    model 1 proposed by Roberto Benavent and Domigo Morales (2015) <DOI: 10.1016/j.csda.2015.07.013.>.
    Benchmarking in Small Area Estimation is a modification of Small Area Estimation model to guarantees that the 
    aggreagate weighted mean of the county predictors equals the corresponding weighted mean of survey estimates.
    Difference Benchmarking is the simplest but widely used  by multiplying EBLUP estimator by the common adjustment 
    factor (J.N.K Rao and Isabela Molina, 2013).

## Installation

You can install the released version of msaeDB from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("msaeDB")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(msaeDB)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
